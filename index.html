					<h6>Coding, Hacking and Analytics</h6><!-- Headline -->
					<p>Coding is a natural for me. I love to code in Java, python and leverage libraries such as scikit-learn to implement machine learning and AI against data. My first <a href="https://devpost.com/rohanc122/challenges">hackathon</a> was in my 9th grade to develop a mobile app in iOS for visually imparied people to read their prescriptions where we placed 5th. My recent work will enable teens to identify messages that can cause depression and help them avoid those messages. Social benefit from coding is the real winner in my work.</p><br><!-- About Text 2 -->

Linear and Logistical regression as well as unsupervised algorithms like K-Means are my favorite. I like tools like Jupyter notebook and BI tools like PowerBI to analyze and visualize. I have a Big Data certification from San Francisco State, Big Data bootcamp from Univ of Penn and a Data Science and Applied Machine Learning certificaiton from UT Austin. My predictions and recommendations in my podcast and writing are based on data science cloud I built.
